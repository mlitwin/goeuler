# goeuler

* Learn go
* Learn algorithms
* Play with project Euler

This is a library of general algorithms. Mostly for use in Project Euler problems. But they are all general - no spoilers here.

## Packages

* The `arith` package will have lower-level entities and functions. See [arith.md](./docs/arith.md)
* The `algo` package complicated algorithms using `arith` for primitives. See [algo.md](./docs/algo.md)
* The `textutil` package contains for reading line based files. An maybe other stuff if it comes up. See [textutil.md](./docs/textutil.md)
